# Andalusi transcriptions

To Do:

* Add consistent variables to all files (or create an "include" file)
* Add copyright code to all files (done through Rasd 3)
* Add dotted bar line `\db` to 4 and 5 (Basit)

## Notes

Introductions

* Rasd intro, from 2009, appears to be the most recent and the most substantial. It updates the Ramal al-Maya (1984) introduction and includes the same examples.
* Rasd intro includes a listing of the four modes that appear within the Rasd nuba (page 104)

## Major questions for discussion

* Introduce the purpose of these transcriptions (as *ürtext*)
	* Show transcriptions of real performance (Shiki, Shami's example in the introduction)
	* Orality, page 207-208: examples of Mulay Ahmad al-Wakili departing from the "aslī" version
* What are these introductions saying about the repertoire?
	* How do they represent modality? What about rhythm?
	* Is there anything to be learned from comparing the various examples?
	* What can I offer that is different than what is already in there?
* How do distinct modes live within a bounded and firmly ordered repertoire?
	* Where are the lines and do they matter in this context?
	* What gives a mode an identity within this type of context (especially when improvisations often borrow from another tradition)?

## Analysis

* Are there four distinct modal segments (Rasd, Hasar, Zidan, Mazmum)?
* Are there motivic consistencies?
* Is there a range- or contour- based development through each movement?
* Where do new pitches appear? Do they signal anything structural?
* What is the best way to measure shifts in tonality? What is the structural or modal context for a given shift?
* Overall trends (perhaps as graphs)
	* Changes in tempo (increasing), lines between time signatures
		* One using song numbers (one tempo per song), another using measures showing a "weighted" distribution of tempo, same two sets of x-axis ticks could serve these others, as well
	* Most common pitches across the repertoire (absolute)
		* Using same x-axis pair, a scatter plot of absolute pitch could show mode and range (with contour)
		* Using same x-axis pair, a scatter plot of pitch classes in each song could show mode
	* Use of certain pitches over time (getting at range)
	* Common one-beat, two-beat motives
	* Repetition
	* Common contour motion
		* Number of notes with less regard to duration
		* Cutting across movements, time signatures, rhythmic feels
* Associate rhythmic accents to musical motion
	* Change from beginning to end of movements? (Relationship to tempo?)
